# Example: Copy

This example uses the python library `numba` to parallelize the operation of copying entries of a given array to another array.

To run the example:
```
python3 copy.py
```

After running the example, two new files `output.raw` and `output.nrrd` should appear in this folder.
The content of `output.raw` should be identical to `../data/example.raw`.
