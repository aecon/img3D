# Example: Object detection 


TODO

These example pipelines combine methods of the `img3` package to perform typical image processing tasks found in biological/medical research.


### Cluster segmentation

Segmentation of illuminated clusters in a 3D image, using two approaches:  
(i) an intensity threshold, and (ii) using the Laplacian of Gaussian.


### Object detection

Segmentation and characterization of illuminated clusters in a 3D image.
