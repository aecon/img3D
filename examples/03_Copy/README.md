# Example: Copy

This example uses the python library `numba` to parallelize the operation of copying entries of a given array to another array.

To run the example:
```
python3 duplicate.py
```

After running the example, two new pairs of raw/nrrd files should appear in this folder (`example3.raw`, `example3o.raw`).
Their content should be identical to `../large_data.tif`.
