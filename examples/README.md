# Examples

Simple and independent use cases for the methods provided in the img3 library.

**Note**: The examples are provided in an incremental learning order.
Knowledge gained from previous examples is assumed known in later examples.


## Data

### Generation on synthetic data
To generate a set of example data:
```
cd data/
python3 gendata.py
```
All examples assume that the synthetic data have been generated.


### Data from light sheet microscopy

A large 3D image dataset is provided in the link below.
The dataset was acquired by Francesca Catto via light-sheet microscopy,
at the University of Zurich, lab of Prof. Adriano Aguzzi.
